# God of War: Axe Throw and Recall Mechanics

# Overview
In this Unity project, I have recreated some of the iconic mechanics from the acclaimed video game God of War. 
Specifically, the axe throw and recall mechanics, which were a staple of the protagonist Kratos' moveset.

Check out [this](https://youtu.be/MI8VVgAylco) video demonstration where I explain some of the functionality of the game in detail.

# Features
- Axe Throw: The player can control the trajectory of the axe by adjusting the angle and power of the throw. The axe will stick to the target upon impact.
- Axe Recall: The axe recall mechanic allows the player to call back the axe to their hand after it has been thrown. The player can recall the axe at any time, even if it is still in motion. 
If the axe hits an enemy on the way back, it will deal damage.
- Attack: The player can perform a simple melee attack with the right mouse button.
